Introduction.

\section{Installation instructions}

This template was tested with TeX Live 2017, which includes all required packages~\cite{TUG2017}. Mac users: this is included as part of OSX and TeXShop. After successfully installing TeX Live, compile the PDF file using your favorite build tool (we tested with \verb!make! on OSX).

\section{How to use this template}
Write each chapter as a separate \LaTeX\ file and include them in \verb!thesis-main.tex!. Edit the abstract, acknowledgments, background, title, dedication, and funding files as necessary. Include additional packages in \verb!thesis-packages.tex! and define helpful macros in \verb!thesis-macros.tex!.

\subsection{Algorithms}
Define each algorithm as a separate \LaTeX\ file in the algorithms folder using either the \verb!algorithmicx! or \verb!algpseudocode! packages. For example, see Algorithm~\ref{algTemplate}.
